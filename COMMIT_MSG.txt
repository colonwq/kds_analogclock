Analog clock: UI tweaks, flicker fix, RTC/network examples, and READMEs

Disclaimer: This patch was created using Cursor AI

=== kds_analogclock (base class) ===

- Hour tic: draw a circle (same size as center dot) at the inner end of the
  first hour tic (12 o'clock). New attribute static_first_tic_circle; created
  once in drawClockHourTics when building the first line.

- Flicker reduction: stop clearing the entire display group each second.
  Track static element count (_static_count) set in drawStatic (and when
  building g1 in drawClock if g1 was None). Each tick, pop only the last
  three items (second, minute, hour hands) and re-append the three hands;
  leave background, circle, tics, and center in place.

- Lazy static group: if drawClock runs with g1 is None (e.g. drawStatic
  skipped), build the static display group once and set _static_count, then
  use the same hand-only replace logic.

- Hour hand bug fix: assign to self.static_hour_hand when creating the line
  and append self.static_hour_hand (was using a local variable and never
  storing the hand).

- Hands origin: all three hands (second, minute, hour) now start from the
  edge of the center dot (radius int(radius * .05) + 1) in the direction
  of each hand instead of from the circle center.

- Messages: convert print() to f-strings; fix typo "responcible" ->
  "responsible" in update/drawStatic messages.

=== Examples: network / RTC / display ===

- PyPortal: Add WiFi credential check before connect (settings.toml or
  secrets.py); raise OSError with clear message if CIRCUITPY_WIFI_SSID or
  CIRCUITPY_WIFI_PASSWORD missing. Catch TypeError (NoneType len) from
  ESP32 SPI and re-raise as OSError with same message. Add import time.
  All prints to f-strings; except blocks catch and print exception
  (ConnectionError, TypeError, Exception as e).

- Qualia S3: Add import time. Prints to f-strings; except Exception as e
  and print(f"Error updating datetime from network: {e}").

- MagTag: Add import time. Prints to f-strings; except Exception as e and
  print exception for get_local_time retry loop.

- FunHouse: Add import time. Same print/except updates as MagTag.

- M4 Matrix: Add import time. Prints to f-strings; except Exception as e
  and print exception for get_local_time retry loop.

- MacroPad: Print time from RTC using f-string (f"Time from connectNetwork(with rtc): {t}").

- Huzzah32: Top-level except ImportError as e and print(f"ImportError loading rtc: {e}").
  All prints converted to f-strings; except KeyError as e and print before
  re-raise in get_strftime.

  RTC (PCF8523) instead of network; monochrome theme; reference to
  RTC-pcf8523/code.py for setting the RTC.

- examples/pyportal/README.md (new): PyPortal; network (WiFi + get_local_time);
  credential check and setup (settings.toml); colored theme.

- examples/qualia-s3/README.md (updated): Qualia; display type from
  DISPLAY_TYPE in settings.toml; network; colored theme; setup and
  display selection details.

- examples/magtag/README.md (new): MagTag e-ink; overridden update() for
  light sleep / time_to_refresh; black-on-white theme; network; setup.

- examples/funhouse/README.md (new): FunHouse; network; colored theme;
  setup.

- examples/m4matrix/README.md (new): MatrixPortal; RGB matrix; network;
  colored theme; setup.

- examples/huzzah32/README.md (new): Feather Huzzah32 + 128x32 I2C OLED;
  no portal; custom display, connectNetwork, get_strftime/get_local_time
  (Adafruit IO time API); monochrome; settings.toml setup.

Each README describes customizations from kds_analogclock (time source:
RTC vs network; display; any overrides), screen drawing/colors, and
setup where applicable.
